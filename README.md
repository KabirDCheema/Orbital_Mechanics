# Orbital_Mechanics

Personal project folder to learn and work through different orbital mechanics problems.

Original thoughts on implementation to make this useful for many different projects:
  - Creating a Satellite object as a base with different configs that can be built in using child classes
  - Util folder for basic operations that will be needed for all projects
  - Projects will be contained within various folder

Want to achieve eventually:
  - Orbit Propogation (2-body)
  - Orbit Propogation (3-body)
  - Orbit raises
  - Inclination changes
  - Attitude Control System
  - Rendezvous and Proximity Operations
